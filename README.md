# project-plan
Track project notes and tasks in one place

# Adapt the doc

This doc starts small, so you expand and customize it as your project grows.
It works on desktop too, where you can use Coda's building blocks to fully customize or extend it.  Some examples:
* Create views that show tasks by status
* Add more properties to each task, like priority
* Add a summary chart
* Share with your team and assign owners
* Add more sections for written documentation

# Get Started
* Open Notes to write notes about the project
* Open Tasks to add tasks
* Open Categories to customize task categories
